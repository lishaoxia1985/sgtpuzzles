<h1><a name="C12"></a>Chapter 42: <a name="i0"></a>Mosaic</h1>
<p>
The board is filled with clues, the clues tell you how many squares around the clue
are black, <b>including</b> the square of the clue itself, the total squares around
the clue are 9 in the middle of the board, 4 in the corners and 6 along the edge.
</p>
<p>
Left-click does a step in the circle of modes: unmarked -> marked -> blank.
</p>
<p>
Right-click (or a long press on Android) does two steps instead of one. 
</p>
<p>
Drag is supported, vertically and horizontally (diagonally is not), sets all unmarked
tiles to the first tile state (according to the button). Right drag might not work
on touchscreens and touchpads.
</p>
<p>
The puzzle is guaranteed to be solvable, using single clues alone (the advanced logic, which
works with more than one clue, is not implemented yet, yet you can play advanced logic puzzles,
they will just fail to auto-solve).

The game is also known as: ArtMosaico, Count and Darken, Cuenta Y Sombrea, Fill-a-Pix,
Fill-In, Komsu Karala, Magipic, Majipiku, Mosaico, Mosaik, Mozaiek, Nampre Puzzle, Nurie-Puzzle, Oekaki-Pix, Voisimage.
Implementation is loosely based on https://github.com/mordechaim/Mosaic

<p>
The options available from the &#8216;Custom...&#8217; option on the &#8216;Type&#8217; menu are:
</p>
<dl><dt>
<em>Width</em>, <em>Height</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Size of grid in squares.
</dd>
<dt>
<em>Aggressive generation (longer)</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Aggressive is making sure that there are no spare clues, it takes a while to check, so it's disabled
in the 50x50 preset, you are welcome to use it, but keep in mind that 50x50 can take minutes to generate
and 100x100 can take over 30 minutes to generate, this may widely vary since it's random.
