<h1><a name="C12"></a>第十二章：<a name="i0"></a>Mines</h1>
<p>
    有一个网格，其中一些方格包含地雷，但你不知道具体是哪个。你的工作是找出每一个没有地雷的方格。如果你无意中点击了一个有地雷的方格，游戏将直接失败。如果一个不包含地雷的方格上标记有数字，该数字表示在该方格周围的八个方格中有多少地雷。
</p>
<p>
    此游戏无需介绍；由于Windows操作系统的普及，它可能是现存最著名的桌面益智游戏。
</p>
<p>
    此版本有一个区别于其他版本的特性：默认情况下，游戏生成的地雷位置，您总是能够以某种方式推断出来，而不需要赌运气。所以你永远不会像在其他版本中那样：当只剩下最后四个方格时发现还有两个地雷，但无法确定它们的具体位置。
</p>
<h2><a name="S12.1"></a>12.1 <a name="i1"></a>Mines controls</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead (Control and Shift are not available). There is also an optional "Night mode" which uses darker colours in low light.</em>
</p>
<p>
This game is played with the mouse.
</p>
<p>
If you left-click in a covered square, it will be uncovered.
</p>
<p>
If you right-click in a covered square, it will place a flag which indicates that the square is believed to be a mine. Left-clicking in a marked square will not uncover it, for safety. You can right-click again to remove a mark placed in error.
</p>
<p>
If you left-click in an <em>uncovered</em> square, it will &#8216;clear around&#8217; the square. This means: if the square has exactly as many flags surrounding it as it should have mines, then all the covered squares next to it which are <em>not</em> flagged will be uncovered. So once you think you know the location of all the mines around a square, you can use this function as a shortcut to avoid having to click on each of the remaining squares one by one.
</p>
<p>
If you uncover a square which has <em>no</em> mines in the surrounding eight squares, then it is obviously safe to uncover those squares in turn, and so on if any of them also has no surrounding mines. This will be done for you automatically; so sometimes when you uncover a square, a whole new area will open up to be explored.
</p>
<p>
You can also use the cursor keys to move around the minefield. Pressing the return key in a covered square uncovers it, and in an uncovered square will clear around it (so it acts as the left button), pressing the space bar in a covered square will place a flag (similarly, it acts as the right button).
</p>
<p>
All the actions described in <a href="common.html#S2.1">section 2.1</a> are also available.
</p>
<p>
Even Undo is available, although you might consider it cheating to use it. If you step on a mine, the program will only reveal the mine in question (unlike most other implementations, which reveal all of them). You can then Undo your fatal move and continue playing if you like. The program will track the number of times you died (and Undo will not reduce that counter), so when you get to the end of the game you know whether or not you did it without making any errors.
</p>
<p>
(If you really want to know the full layout of the grid, which other implementations will show you after you die, you can always use the Solve menu option.)
</p>
<h2><a name="S12.2"></a>12.2 <a name="i2"></a>Mines parameters</h2>
<p>
The options available from the &#8216;Custom...&#8217; option on the &#8216;Type&#8217; menu are:
</p>
<dl><dt>
<em>Width</em>, <em>Height</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Size of grid in squares.
</dd>
<dt>
<em>Mines</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Number of mines in the grid. You can enter this as an absolute mine count, or alternatively you can put a <code>%</code> sign on the end in which case the game will arrange for that proportion of the squares in the grid to be mines.
<p>
Beware of setting the mine count too high. At very high densities, the program may spend forever searching for a solvable grid.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<em>Ensure solubility</em>
</dt>
<dd>
When this option is enabled (as it is by default), Mines will ensure that the entire grid can be fully deduced starting from the initial open space. If you prefer the riskier grids generated by other implementations, you can switch off this option.
</dd>
