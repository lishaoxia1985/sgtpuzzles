<h1><a name="C16"></a>第十六章：<a name="i0"></a>Pegs</h1>
<p>
    许多钉子钉在木板上，可以通过跳过相邻的钉子（水平或垂直方向）来移除该相邻钉子。您的目标是通过跳过其他钉子来移除钉子，直到只剩下最后一个钉子。
</p>
<p>
    此谜题最著名的名字是“Peg Solitaire”（独立钻石），它可能是至今仍广为人知的最古老的益智游戏之一。
</p>
<h2><a name="S16.1"></a>16.1 <a name="i2"></a>Pegs controls</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead (Control and Shift are not available). There is also an optional "Night mode" which uses darker colours in low light.</em>
</p>
<p>
To move a peg, drag it with the mouse from its current position to its final position. If the final position is exactly two holes away from the initial position, is currently unoccupied by a peg, and there is a peg in the intervening square, the move will be permitted and the intervening peg will be removed.
</p>
<p>
Vacant spaces which you can move a peg into are marked with holes. A space with no peg and no hole is not available for moving at all: it is an obstacle which you must work around.
</p>
<p>
You can also use the cursor keys to move a position indicator around the board. Pressing the return key while over a peg, followed by a cursor key, will jump the peg in that direction (if that is a legal move).
</p>
<p>
(All the actions described in <a href="common.html#S2.1">section 2.1</a> are also available.)

Controls whether you are given a board of a standard shape or a randomly generated shape. The two standard shapes currently supported are &#8216;Cross&#8217; and &#8216;Octagon&#8217; (also commonly known as the English and European traditional board layouts respectively). Selecting &#8216;Random&#8217; will give you a different board shape every time (but always one that is known to have a solution).
