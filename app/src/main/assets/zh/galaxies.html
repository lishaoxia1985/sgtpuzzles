<h1><a name="C28"></a>第二十八章：<a name="i0"></a>Galaxies</h1>
<p>
    一个矩形网格包含了一些白点。你的目标是将该网格分割成若干连续区域，每个区域都包含一个白点，且都以白点为原点中心对称。
</p>
<p>
    解谜方法：在网格上画线分割网格。
</p>
<p>
    此谜题是由<a name="i1"></a>Nikoli <a href="#p0">[13]</a>发明的，名字是“Tentai Show”，英文名通常被译为“Spiral Galaxies”。
</p>

    “Galaxies”游戏是由James Harvey贡献的。

<h2><a name="S28.1"></a>28.1 <a name="i2"></a>Galaxies controls</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead (Control and Shift are not available). There is also an optional "Night mode" which uses darker colours in low light.</em>
</p>
<p>
Left-click on any grid line to draw an edge if there isn't one already, or to remove one if there is. When you create a valid region (one which is closed, contains exactly one dot, is 180&#176; symmetric about that dot, and contains no extraneous edges between two of its own squares), it will be highlighted automatically; so your aim is to have the whole grid highlighted in that way.
</p>
<p>
During solving, you might know that a particular grid square belongs to a specific dot, but not be sure of where the edges go and which other squares are connected to the dot. In order to mark this so you don't forget, you can right-click on the dot and drag, which will create an arrow marker pointing at the dot. Drop that in a square of your choice and it will remind you which dot it's associated with. You can also right-click on existing arrows to pick them up and move them, or destroy them by dropping them off the edge of the grid. (Also, if you're not sure which dot an arrow is pointing at, you can pick it up and move it around to make it clearer. It will swivel constantly as you drag it, to stay pointed at its parent dot.)
</p>
<p>
You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid squares and lines. Pressing the return key when over a grid line will draw or clear its edge, as above. Pressing the return key when over a dot will pick up an arrow, to be dropped the next time the return key is pressed; this can also be used to move existing arrows around, removing them by dropping them on a dot or another arrow.
</p>

(All the actions described in <a href="common.html#S2.1">section 2.1</a> are also available.)
